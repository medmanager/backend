# Backend for Med Manager 3.0

(Assuming you've already installed NodeJs, Express, and MongoDB)

After installation of files, navigate to the backend folder and type:
```
npm install
```
This will install the project's dependencies. 


To run on the API on your server locally, type:
```
npm start
```
You can access the server using the url: http://localhost:4000/
Note that you can change the PORT in index.js

Download Postman here to test the API: https://www.postman.com/downloads/
